## INTRODUCTION
Thyroid cancer is one of the most common types of endocrine cancers, with an increasing incidence globally. Though early detection and diagnosis are crucial for improving outcomes in patients, the complex clinical procedured and interpretation of medical data causes delays and errors in diagnosis. However, with machine learning, healthcare providers can predict the presence and type of thyroid cancer based on features like medical history, test results, age, sex, etc. So, in this machine learning project, I have used the Thyroid Cancer dataset from Kaggle for my model training. This project aims to provide an accessible, efficient and reliable tool for early cancer detection thus reducing diagnostic errors. 
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately diagnosise thyroid cance based on patients medical data. Since the dataset contains features like age, sex, clinical features, and medical records, the goal is to use classification method to determine whether a patient has thyroid cancer or not.
### OBJECTIVES
1. Classify patients at risk of having throid cancer
2. Classify cancer stage by age and gender
3. Identify features contributing to Thyroid cancer
4. Train and test the model in heallthcare scenario
